In order to execute the tests, the GTMCI environment variable
must be set to point to the location of the associated .ci file.

For example,

Before running the "test002" executable,
set GTMCI to the full path of the "test002.ci" file.

This could be something like:

      export GTMCI=/home/ibanez/bin/m.js/lib/test002.ci
