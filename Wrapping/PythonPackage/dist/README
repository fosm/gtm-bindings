Post-Installation
=================

Now that you have installed the .egg distribution of the python bindings for
GT.M, you need to perform the following two post-installation steps.

A) Define GTMCI environment variable.

   The GTMCI environment variable must contain the full path
   to the file gtm_access.ci.

   After installation, this .ci file will in the same directory
   as this README file.

   for example:

      /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gtm-1.0.0-py2.7.egg/


   therefore you can set GTMCI as

    export GTMCI=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gtm-1.0.0-py2.7.egg/gtm_access.ci


B) Copy the _gtmaccess.m file to the directory where you have GT.M routines.

   This typically will be one of the directories that you added to the
   environment variable gtmroutines when you installed GT.M in your system.


Once this two steps have been taken, you should be able to launch python
and type code similar to:


  from gtm import GTM

  db = GTM()

  db.set("^Capital","London")

  capital = db.get("^Capital")

  print "Capital = ", capital
