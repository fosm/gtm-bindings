How to install.

Once you have finished the build of the Python wrapping via SWIG, as configured
by CMake:

* Go to the binary directory of the build.
* Enter the directory "Wrapping"
* Type the command

      sudo python ./PythonPackage/setup.py install

This will install the files:

     gtm.py
     gtm.pyc

in the directory:  /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

and the file

    _gtm.so

in the directory:  /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
