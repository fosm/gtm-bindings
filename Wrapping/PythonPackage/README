How to install
==============

Once you have finished the build of the Python wrapping via SWIG, as configured
by CMake:

* Go to the binary directory of the build.
* Enter the directory "Wrapping"
* Type the command

      sudo python ./PythonPackage/setup.py install

This will install the files:

     gtm.py
     gtm.pyc

in the directory:  /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

and the file

    _gtm.so

in the directory:  /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages



How to Package
==============

From the top of the BINARY directory, use the following commands

    make  prepare.Python
    make  build.Python
    make  dist.Python




How to Distribute
=================

and finally, upload the .egg file to pypi at

            http://pypi.python.org/pypi

For this last operation you should be registered at pypi.



One can also upload a source distribution with the command:

    cd BINARY_DIR/Wrapping/PythonPackage
    python ./setup.py sdist upload
